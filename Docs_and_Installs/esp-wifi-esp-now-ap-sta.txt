Yes, an ESP32 can be set to operate as both a Wi-Fi station and an access point simultaneously by setting its mode to WIFI_AP_STA. This is known as combined AP-STA mode. 
Here are some other ways an ESP32 can be used: 
Access point (AP)
The ESP32 creates its own Wi-Fi network, allowing nearby devices to connect to it without needing to connect to a router. This is also known as soft-AP mode. 
Station
The ESP32 connects to a wireless router, which acts as an access point. The ESP32 can then be accessed through the local network. 
Server and client
One ESP32 board can act as a server, and another can act as a client. The server creates its own wireless network. 
The typical Wi-Fi range of an ESP32 is around 50–200 meters, depending on the antennas.

How many devices can connect to ESP32 access point?
Currently, ESP32 Wi-Fi supports up to 10 Wi-Fi connections. If max_connection > 10, soft-AP defaults the value to 10. If you use softAP, you can set the max number of connections to 16 I believe.Aug 29, 2018
